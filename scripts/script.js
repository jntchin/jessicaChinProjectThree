//pseudocode goes here

//on a click event, animate a 20-sided polygon (rotate) 
//add message (html) saying "click to stop"
//on another click event, stop the animation
//add message saying "click for a new roll"
//show a random number from 1 to 20 on the die itself
//show a total value

//listen for a form submit from the drop-down menu
//on a submit, add that number to the die value
//prevent default / refresh for form submission
//show a total score


//STRETCH GOALS
//on a click event, animate other polygons (6, 4, 10, 12, 8-sided dice)
//
